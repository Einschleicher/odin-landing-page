# odin-landing-page
My second project from TheOdinProject (HTML/CSS/Flexbox) 

In this project, I'm going to build a basic landing-page.
The website will consist of 4 sections and a footer.

#### Self-reflection

*You learn a lot by building a project from scratch. Just following tutorials is nowhere near as effective.*

*I'm looking forward to do more project based learning.*
